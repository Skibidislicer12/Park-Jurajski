                    <img src="../zdj/ucieczka.jpg" class="artykuł-photo">
                    <p>In the darkness of the night at Jurassic Park, where thousands of years of prehistoric history intertwine with modern technology, something unprecedented happened. Suddenly, as if on command, the lights went out, leaving guests and staff in complete darkness. The electric fence, which had previously separated them from potential danger, suddenly ceased to spark, and a dark silence filled the space.

                        Enveloped in darkness, the sounds of dinosaurs became louder. The noise of footsteps and rustling suddenly caught the attention of those who had previously felt safe. The raptors, usually described as intelligent and cunning, began to gather around the fence, their shadows moving like specters in the darkness.
                        
                        Panic gripped everyone. Guests, who had moments ago admired the giant creatures from afar, now desperately sought shelter, aware that in this darkness they were completely defenseless. The park staff tried to maintain composure, but concern was evident in their eyes.
                        
                        Amidst fear and chaos, questions arose: What happened? Is it just a technical malfunction, or something more? Can dinosaurs understand that the fence is no longer working?
                        
                        In the darkness, where even the slightest sound seemed like a threat, the park plunged into silence, interrupted only by whispers and muffled screams. Jurassic Park, which had previously seemed like a place of wonders and fascinating discoveries, now became an arena of survival in the heartless night.</p>

                    <h2>Closure for 5 Minutes</h2>
                    <img src="../zdj/zamkniecie.jpg" class="artykuł-photo">
                    <p>The closure of the park at Jurassic Park triggered a cascade of reactions, the effects of which were felt at every level. Here is a description of the situation:

                        The long, metallic gates of the park, which were usually open to adventure enthusiasts, now slammed shut sharply with the sound of final closure. This symbolic act marked the end of days of open doors for guests.
                        
                        The park staff, who had previously crowded the corridors, working tirelessly on various aspects of attractions and safety, now acted decisively and swiftly. Their task was to ensure that every animal in the park would be safely separated from humans and other creatures.
                        
                        The announcement of the park closure was quickly communicated to both guests and staff. A large banner at the park gate displayed a warning about the closure, and megaphones along the pathways conveyed messages about the necessity of immediate evacuation.
                        
                        Guests, who had arrived earlier with hopes of an unforgettable adventure, now left the park with a sense of disappointment and disorientation. Many of them realized the gravity of the situation, seeing the park staff moving decisively and with concentration on their faces.
                        
                        A silence fell over the park, interrupted only by the sounds of preparations for closure. During this time, the park staff worked tirelessly to ensure that every animal would be safe and separated from humans until the situation was finally resolved.
                        
                        The closure of the park was a necessity aimed at ensuring the safety of guests, staff, and animals. It was also a symbolic ending to a chapter in the history of Jurassic Park, emphasizing the importance and responsibility that came with running such a place.
